activate a virtual environment that is specific to your project via the console and $pipenv shell

there is no init in our models because we inherit from models and which has a built in init and we just give it attributes

ex: birthday = models.DateField(null=True, blank=True)
we need both null = True and blank = True because one is for database and one is for the form. these fields by default are required(its telling the form & database that it's okay for it to be blank)

i have a model that has a structure, i told the model which attributes i care about via the form field. we go to the view, the view says i have a form for that... i'm going to render this bit of html with this context which is the additional data that the page needs.

{{form.as_p}} in add_contact.html shows up in the front end
- we start by looking at url patterns... we see which page the user is going to enter. the user is going to contacts.add which calls add_contact view

SQL is the language that the database speaks.

db.sqlite3 is a file that shows my database but without a tool that can read it, i can't access that file, which is why we might use tools like dbbrowser

this explains the creation of foreign keys and the database


class Favorite(models.Model):
    user = models.ForeignKey(
        User, on_delete=models.CASCADE, related_name="favorites")
    contact = models.ForeignKey(
        Contact, on_delete=models.CASCADE, related_name="favorites")


it will have a user field that will point to particular instanceof user model and there will be a table field that will point to a particular instance of table
- this example was about connecting two different models together


def show_contact(request, pk):
    contact = get_object_or_404(Contact, pk=pk)
    # went to the database and got a piece of data
    notes = Note.objects.filter(contact=pk)

    return render(request, "contacts/individual_contact.html", {"contact": contact, "notes": notes})
    # now the context dictionary passes data to the template
    # dont need line 35 because of the related name
